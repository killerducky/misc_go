It is called an Iron Man tournament because endurance is key to doing well in this tournament. There will be 20 rounds spread over 5 days, with a new round starting every six hours. You can skip up to 15 rounds, so even if you can only play one round per day, you can still participate in this tournament! But of course, playing in more rounds than the minimum of 5 will give you a better final position - as long as you manage to win the extra rounds that you play in!</p>

<p>As usual, a limited number (100 to open division, none to the handicap one) of non-KGS Plus members are allowed. Make sure to tell your friends about this so they can register in time! </p>

<p>To choose which rounds you sit out, click on the link to the right where you sign up for byes. If you are on the server when a round starts, and you haven't requested a bye, then you must play in the round or take a loss.</p>

<p>The handicap division is an handicap tournament for players 1d or weaker. The open division is open to all the ratings. The time settings are 45 minutes plus byo yomi (5 periods of 30 seconds).</p>
